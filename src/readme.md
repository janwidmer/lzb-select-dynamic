lazy-blocks custom control to offer a dynamic select containing wordpress posts or categories

## Description

This custom control can be used in blocks to offer the Wordpress Author to choose either wordpress pages or taxonomies like categories.

## Installation

### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of lzb-select-dynamic, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type lzb-select-dynamic and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our lzb-select-dynamic plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).
